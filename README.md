Overview:

This program is a multi-user blog site wherein users may create, like, and
comment on posts generated by registered/logged in users. Users may only alter
their own posts, and may only like the posts of others.

How it is implemented:

This site is built to be hosted on Google AppEngine. The site can be deployed
using Google AppEngine Launcher, or on the command line, a process which is
well-documented on Google's AppEngine site. A yaml file must match the name of
an app registered on The AppEngine site before deployment.

Use:

The site should be accessible through many (if not all) browsers. URLs can be
set in the file title "main.py", at the bottom of the file.
The site can currently be reached at "taburlrasa.appspot.com".
